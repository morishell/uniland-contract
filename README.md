## A mysterious universe based on the classic game Othello on Aleo chain

Here, every planet contains valuable nutrients, waiting for brave explorers to discover. The acquisition of nutrients is aimed at rewarding explorers who successfully challenge AI Mori. In this cosmic adventure, you can not only experience the challenge and fun of Othello, but also have the opportunity to participate in this journey of wisdom while making every move. We use Aleo ZK privacy blockchain technology to ensure your privacy and the privacy of other explorers in the decision-making process, and share the rich nutrients of the Genesis planet.

## Game Rules

- Game Participants: UniLand welcomes all explorers who are willing to accept the challenge. As a participant, you can vote on immature planets and decide their future.
- Privacy Protection: We use Aleo ZK privacy blockchain technology to protect the privacy of participants. When voting, you cannot know the voting situation of other explorers.
- Voting System: When the number of votes exceeds half of the legal positions of an immature planet, the voting ends. At this time, the planet will mature and generate new game branches. Planets that do not participate in voting will be destroyed.
- Reward Mechanism: When humans win on a wisdom planet, the nutrients of that planet will be shared by explorers. Each planet will send 50% of its nutrients to its parent star, and the remaining nutrients will be divided equally among the explorers who participated in the decision-making of that planet. If humans fail on a planet, there is no reward for that planet.
- Voting Restrictions: Each participant can only cast 1 vote on each step, but there is no limit to the total number of votes in the entire universe.

Join us now and explore this mysterious universe together, get the nutrients of wisdom planets. Here, everyone has the potential to be the key to victory and share the joy of nutrients. UniLand looks forward to your joining, let us create a more intelligent future together!

## Experimental

UniLand is not just an Othello game, but an experimental extension of ZK privacy blockchain technology. We aim to transfer more collective intelligence of players to AI, and this process hopes to realize voting management and reward distribution through ZKâ€™s privacy technology. This makes the game interaction more fair and interesting, and traces the intellectual contributions of humans.
